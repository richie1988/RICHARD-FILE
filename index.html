  </p> It is my pleasure to introduce you to each other! Richard is from Zambia and Kareem from Egypt and for this next step of the process, you two will be collaborating (and hopefully having a lot of coding fun) for close to four (4) hours. Please read through this email carefully to make sure you understand what is required of you.
  </P>
